# Project-Reborn-Rain
A repository for my 3rd person prototype roguelight shooter. This repository holds most of the scripts used, I am unable to upload the full project due to the paid assets in the project. The project is currently in an early prototype phase, but feedback is welcome! The following link will allow you to play a web build of the game.

If you have any audio issues, you may have to enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings. 

Known issues in the current build: Mouse input seems to be lower than local build and previous builds. 

## In progress: 
- A skill leveling system that will allow players to level up their primary and secondary skills, as well as character related abilities. 
- A second character with a melee focus! I just finished rigging the IK on this character in blender and have started on some custom animations https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41479497/212588092-3de59a22-be74-4a14-9aec-55ea518a84b4.mp4
